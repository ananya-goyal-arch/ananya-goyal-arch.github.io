Hello, I'm **Ananya Goyal**, an architect with six years of experience in the dynamic field of architecture. My journey in architecture has been fueled by a deep passion for design and a commitment to creating functional, aesthetically pleasing spaces. 

## Professional Experience

Over the past six years, I have honed my skills and expertise through diverse projects, ranging from industrial complexes to residential and commercial buildings. My portfolio includes:

- **Industrial Projects**: Designing large-scale manufacturing facilities, warehouses, and distribution centers. These projects have strengthened my ability to balance functionality, safety, and efficiency with innovative design.
  
- **Residential Projects**: Creating custom home designs that reflect the unique lifestyles and preferences of clients, ensuring comfort and elegance.
  
- **Commercial Projects**: Developing office buildings, retail spaces, and mixed-use developments, emphasizing both practicality and visual appeal.

## Skills and Expertise

I am proficient in a variety of architectural tools and software, which allows me to bring my designs to life with precision and clarity. My key skills include:

- **Revit**: Expertise in creating detailed 3D models, allowing for comprehensive visualization and collaboration throughout the design and construction process.
  
- **AutoCAD**: Proficient in drafting and detailing, ensuring accurate and high-quality construction documents.

## Personal Interests

Outside of my professional work, I have a keen interest in Origami and Kirigami. These intricate art forms have taught me the importance of patience, precision, and creativityâ€”qualities that I bring to my architectural practice. Both Origami and Kirigami not only inspire my designs but also enhance my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail.
